# Tech Usage and Reasoning  
Like many developers may agree on, learning a new language or framework is always exiting. In combination, creating a todo-list will usually give a good start to the learning, getting familiar to multiple important topics in a such and small application. As I wanted to learn more about Vue, I decided to do exactly so - dive into the framework attempting to learn.  
 
# Challenges Faced 
As mentioned in the section above, right from the get-go there was a really clear task ahead of me. The direct challenges I faced was therefor not related to my goal, but related to my beginning experience towards the Vue framework.
